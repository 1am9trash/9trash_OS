Guns for Hire Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Hold the die, your turn to roll
Before they fall through your fingers
Not a good night to lose control
Right as the Earth is unraveling
You play with your blocks until they break
And these walls come tumbling down
Oh, they're tumbling down

[Pre-Chorus]
You're out of time, make your move
Live or die while the fuse is lit and there's no turning back
[Chorus]
Kiss your perfect day goodbye
Because the world is on fire
Tuck your innocence goodnight
You sold your friends like guns for hire
Go play with your blocks
And now you'll pay
When these walls come tumbling down
Oh, they're tumbling down

[Verse 2]
Resting on a knife, you heavy souls
With all this weight buckling down on you now
Don't you drown and float away
Not a good time to lose control
Right as your marionettes cut their strings and run away

[Pre-Chorus]
You're out of time, make your move
Live or die while the fuse is lit and there's no turning back

[Chorus]
Kiss your perfect day goodbye
Because the world is on fire
Tuck your innocence goodnight
You sold your friends like guns for hire
Go play with your blocks
And now you'll pay
When these walls come tumbling down
Oh, they're tumbling down
